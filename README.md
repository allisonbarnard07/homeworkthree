Homework Three - Password Generator
<br>
For this homework I created a password generator using JS
<br>
Initally I set up all my arrays
<br>
I then added a function to generate the password which includes while, if statement to ensure correct password length (via a prompt asking what length of password user wants) and variables including empty strings to display results based on what the user chooses for their password criteria. Also, I used concat to add on
what the user chose for their criteria from the confirms.
<br>
I ended with a loop that includes a MathRandom to ensure the characters chosen were indeed random.
